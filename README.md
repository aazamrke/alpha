# alpha
The purpose of this project is to develop an API using Django that fetches the price of BTC/USD from the alphavantage API every hour, and stores it on postgres. This API has been secured which means that you will need an API key to use it. There should be two endpoints: GET /api/v1/quotes - returns exchange rate and POST /api/v1/quotes which triggers force requesting the prices from alphavantage. The API &amp; DB has been containerized using Docker as well. - Every part has been implemented as simple as possible.The technologies has been used: Celery, Redis or RabbitMQ, Docker and Docker Compose. - The sensitive data such as alphavantage API key, should be passed from the .env
